Add classes to a Shopping Cart GUI.

Chapter 10, Shopping Cart, p.699 Programming Project. Details are attached below in pdf document.  I also attach the provided Java classes (the GUI interface) to get you started.  DO NOT change these provided classes, else your code will not meet my specifications, and won't work when I test your solutions.

Start by just getting the main() method to run:  You can create nearly empty classes and methods that are required to pass the compiler, doing trivial operations like "return 42;" when you see the real solution might be difficult.  And comment out most of the main() method class.  Just get the JFrame to show up first, then start adding code to complete the project........

Attach the FOUR .java files that you wrote to complete this assignment. 

As always attach your QA word document of test cases run with screen shots of output of your running program. You need to include in your test cases and screenshots.  

Make sure to include the following test cases in your QA document.

Test Case 1(example in the assignment) : 2 silly putty, 3 bottle of bubbles, 1 Nintendo Wii System, 1 Computer Science pen, 4 Computer Science Barbies, and 12 "Java Rules!" button for an order total of $491.20. When the "qualify for discount" is checked then it should change to $442.08.

Test Case 2:  One silly putty cost $3.95 and 11 are $23.94, plus one of everything else on the list totals $552.87, but $497.58 if I check the discount, and $479.59 if I remove the Barbie.

Other test cases are up to you.

Remember to make sure your name, class, date, etc.. is at the top of every file you submit along with well commented code.
